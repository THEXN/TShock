## General To Do
* Tile Banlist based on Item Banlist
* Revamp regions to have flags for configuring item bans, npc bans, force pvp, block access, switch usage
* Character name based accounts.
* Implement permissions for "cheating" mana/hp/stacks. Need to figure a method to "manage" the maximum tp bypass per group.
* Implement more configs and permissions for server side inventory mode
* Implement configs and group overrides for item banlist
* Update LogTile
* Tile create and destroy verification based on selected item
* Projectile spawning verification based on selected item
