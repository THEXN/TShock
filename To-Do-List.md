## General To Do
* Consider moving alot of stuff outside of tshock into respective admin plugins.
* Improve Item Banlist
* Improve Ban System
* Fix chest protection in regions. Causing item duplication.
* Tile Banlist
* Tile placement and Removal Verification based on inventory
* Improve spam checks for place and kill tile.
* Add spam check to liquids (Not built in one)
 * Maybe make an exploit plugin instead of stuffing it into tshock
* Update LogTile
* Improve documentation everywhere. ( lol maybe move to confluence? )
* Force time to day or night in configs
* Better player cap/slot handling, reserved slot support
* Revamp regions to have flags for configuring item bans, npc bans, force pvp, block access
* /mute command for tshock( dark commited this earlier today )
* Hallow/Corruption control settings
* Require login config (not server side inventory)
* Double check item ban system on item use and blocking player animations.
* Commands to manage item bans maybe not working.( the bug about it not deleting seems to be a false report )
* Implement permissions for "cheating" mana/hp/stacks. Need to figure a method to "manage" the maximum tp bypass per group.
* Implement more configs and permissions for server side inventory mode
* Mana for Server Side Inventory fails. redo it.
