## General To Do
* Allow to ban tiles based on item banlist
* Revamp regions to have flags for configuring item bans, npc bans, force pvp, block access, switch usage
* Character name based accounts. (More TDSM like, will likely kill old accounts in next release, Need to discuss...)
* Implement permissions for "cheating" mana/hp/stacks. Likely have a max hp, max mana, max item stack in groups
* Implement group overrides for item banlist. Have a ignore groups list on each item ban( done but should be tested.  Wont delete until testing has occurred )
* Implement more configs/permissions/commands for server side inventory mode
* Update LogTile
* Tile create and destroy verification based on selected item
* Projectile spawning verification based on selected item
* Disallow all non player placeable tiles
