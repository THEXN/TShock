# Installing from stable downloads
1. Download the latest package from the [downloads section](https://github.com/TShock/TShock/downloads).
2. Extract the package into the folder you wish to run TShock from.
 * Note, if running on Linux, make sure the ServerPlugins folder has the correct casing.
3. Install sqlite3. If on Windows, go to http://www.sqlite.org/download.html and download the precompiled DLL and place sqlite3.dll with TerrariaServer.exe
