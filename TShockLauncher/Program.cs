/*
 * The purpose of this project is to be the launcher of the TSAPI server.
 * We use this project:
 *	- to copy/move around TShockAPI.dll (the TShock plugin to TSAPI)
 *	- to publish TShock releases.
 *	- move dependencies to a ./bin folder
 *
 * The assembly name of this launcher (TShock.exe) was decided on by a community poll.
