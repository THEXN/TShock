Hello! Thanks for choosing TShock. As you walk through the installation procedure, note the 'Issues' tab at the top. If you have any problems at all, we can handle them there. If the problem is something you'd rather not share, or you don't want to create a [Github](http://github.com/) account, you can email your suggestions to _shank [at] shankshock [dot] com_.

## Downloading TShock
Click on the source tab at the top, and click the big downloads button on the right hand side. You want the download labeled latest.

## Installling
### Extract
Extract the all the contents into a folder.  This will be your server folder.  Everything is already included.

### Install
In the new folder you have made, run TerrariaServer.exe, It will automatically create all the necessary files/folders on startup.

Now close the TerrariaServer.exe , you've just generated the necessary files and folders.

Move the **TShockAPI.dll**, **XNAHelpers.dll** and **Newtonsoft.Json.dll** to the ServerPlugins folder and run the TerrariaServer.exe again.

### Become an Admin

Once the server starts the console window will give an auth code. Note this down somewhere.

Join the server and enter /auth [authcode]. This will make you a superadmin on the server, giving you access to all commands. Quit the server and rejoin to complete the process.

**OR**

You could add yourself on the Users.txt, in the tshock folder.
Simply put your IP address [Check External IP](http://www.whatismyip.com)
followed by 'superadmin' beside it.
eg.

`#start of users.txt`

`182.158.12.5 superadmin`


## Finishing
Your server should now be successfully running TShock. Familiarize yourself with the [[Commands]], and have a fun time administrating your new server.
